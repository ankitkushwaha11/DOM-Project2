# DOM-Project2
This DOM project allows users to toggle between "Stranger" and "Friend" using a card layout. Each card has an image, a "Stranger" heading, and an "Add Friend" button. Clicking the button changes the heading to "Friend" and the button to "Remove Friend," and vice versa. It's a simple example of DOM manipulation with event handling using JavaScript.
